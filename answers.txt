Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: I'd consider using git because it's a free, open source, popular way to store files that also allows me to see previous changes to files easily (file history). It's also really good for collaboration.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: One field data science could be applied to is sports. It allows us to keep track of things like player statistics, and is great for predicting the outcomes of games or the likelihood of injuries. It's also useful for allowing teams to come up with the optimal, appropriate strategy to beat their opponent.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines changes from two branches while keeping their history visible, but rebasing applies commits from one branch on top of another and rewrites commit history.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to get better at data science as a whole in general, since it isn't something I plan on focusing on but is useful to know. I also think more experience with things like Git and SQL is always good to have so I'm looking forward to that.
